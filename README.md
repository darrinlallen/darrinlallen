- 🔭 I’m currently working on a social media platform built around television commercials.  contact me if 
you want to partner to make an AI app that  makes a
searchable video commercial advertisement database .
this would be a netflix/youtube clone exclusively for tv commercials.   business model is to get companies to pay to upload commercials. this would also have a social media aspect to it. basically all your ads belong in my searchable database!! 
if you want to partner contact me here.  darrin.lovard.allen@gmail.com
- 🌱 Ive got some other ideas also.  one idea is creating a business around free website creation .
this would churn out free websites for anyone or anything .
we would initially take donations .  artificial intelligence would do most of the work. this would be a hyper competitive godaddy with a personal touch and customer service built around completed projects.
but the whole thing is free based on donations .  your own free web design studio.



I’m learning from a fire hydrant!!!!  
- 💬 Ask me about **Node.js, React, Firebase... HTML, CSS, JavaScript**  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I took a vacation to **Hong Kong** and also **Jamaica**!
